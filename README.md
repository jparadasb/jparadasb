### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is JosÃ©, welcome to my little space of WIP projects.

## About me

I've been working as a Software Developer for over seven years. 

One of the words that can describe me is curious. I have many questions, and I'm always looking for the answers. 

I like to experiment and create things to learn around the process. For example, I built my house lab using raspberry pies to create a k3s cluster in my house because I wanted to learn Kubernetes. And currently, I use it to keep live the services dedicated to the automation of lights and sensors at home.

My other passion is astrophotography, I want to have more compression about outer space, and I like to have snapshots of the stars. I enjoy the process of revealing a raw picture and how to use programs to stack and create beautiful full stars images. So, I have some ideas to make things with IoT and photography on my list. 

About my work experience

I have been working with several languages and frameworks.
I like to work with React from the front-end side. I have experience with it in almost every of my last work positions, but I also have experience working with javascript in general. 
I have experience working with Nodejs from the back-end side using express as a framework.
My most recent experience as a back-end developer was using Elixir and Phoenix, and I love it.
